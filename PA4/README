TEST CASES
Part I: I added extra .in test cases to TestCases/ . You can test them by running ./regress.sh (if the outputs are the same diff will not print anything)
Although I added tokens for the complete grammar I only have test cases for PA2

Part II: I added program test cases for the compiler in compilerTestCases. You can run them with ./regress.sh. Since my error handling is different than the provided compiler, PA2Error.java produces a different message (mine just throws and error and prints to stderr)
The testing consists of generating two assembly files for each program, one from my compiler and one from the starter code compiler. I then run each through MJSIM.jar and compare the outputs (diff will print nothing if the outputs are the same).


ERROR HANDLING
My compiler will output throw an error if you try to cast something bigger than a byte to a byte. That test case is PA2ByteCastError.java
There will also be an error if you try to give a value higher than 8 to the setPixel function
In both these cases no assembly file will be generated

REFLECTION
Once I figured out the cup syntax it wasn't too bad
